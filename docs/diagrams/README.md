This directory contains [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) files for UML sequence and class diagrams
illustrating various aspect of `yapapi` code architecture and execution.

To create diagrams from `.puml` files you need `java` and `plantuml.jar`
which can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/plantuml/files/plantuml.jar/download.

Generate `diagram.png` from the source file `diagram.puml` with:
```shell script
java -jar plantuml.jar diagram.puml
```

See https://plantuml.com/starting for more information on using PlantUML
(for example, how to generate diagram files in formats other than PNG)
and on the syntax of `.puml` files.
