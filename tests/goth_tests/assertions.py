"""Temporal assertions used in `goth` integration tests.

The assertions express properties of lines of output printed by requestor
scripts (e.g. `blender.py`) to their stdout or stderr. For example, one such
property would be that if the requestor script prints a line containing
the string "Agreement confirmed by provider P", for any name P, then
eventually it will also print a line containing "Accepted invoice from P".
