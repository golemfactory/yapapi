"""
Useful, reusable pieces of code built on top of `yapapi`.

This part of `yapapi` repository serves to provide requestor agent application authors with reusable
components that we or third-party developers found useful while working on examples and apps that
use our Python API.

They're not strictly part of the high level API library itself and while we do intend to keep them
in sync with the subsequent releases, they should be treated as experimental and their interface
may change without a proper deprecation process.
