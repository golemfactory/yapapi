        developer of the specific :class:`Service` class to decide what exact operations constitute a
        service startup. In the most common scenario :func:`~yapapi.script.Script.deploy()` and
        :func:`~yapapi.script.Script.start()` are required,

        to the activity by the engine.

        statements.

        A clean exit from a handler function triggers the engine to transition the state of the
        instance to the next stage in service's lifecycle - in this case, to `running`.

        On the other hand, any unhandled exception will potentially trigger a restart
        of an instance on another provider node. This is behavior is controlled by Service's
        `restart_condition` property and by default restarts instances only if they encountered
        an error and had not been successfully started before.

        To change this default, override the `restart_condition`.

        **Example**::


            async def start(self):
                s = self._ctx.new_script()
                # deploy the exe-unit
                s.deploy(**self.get_deploy_args())
                # start the exe-unit's container
                s.start()
                # start some service process within the container
                s.run("/golem/run/service_ctl", "--start")
                # send the batch to the provider
                yield s

        ### Default implementation

        The default implementation assumes that, in order to accept commands, the runtime needs to
        be first deployed using the :func:`~yapapi.script.Script.deploy` command, which is analogous
        to creation of a container corresponding with the desired payload, and then started using the
        :func:`~yapapi.script.Script.start` command,
        actually launching the process that runs the aforementioned container.

        Additionally, it also assumes that the exe-unit doesn't need any additional parameters
        in its :func:`~yapapi.script.Script.start` call (e.g. for the VM runtime, all the required parameters are
        already passed as part of the agreement between the requestor and the provider), and parameters
        passed to :func:`~yapapi.script.Script.deploy` are returned by :func:`Service.get_deploy_args()` method.

        Therefore, this default implementation performs the minimum required for a VM payload to
        start responding to `run` commands. If your service requires any additional operations -
        you'll need to override this method (possibly first yielding from the parent - `super().start()` - generator)
        to add appropriate preparatory steps.

        In case of runtimes other than VM, `deploy` and/or `start` might be optional or altogether
        disallowed, or they may take some parameters. It is up to the author of the
        specific `Service` implementation that uses such a payload to adjust this method accordingly
        based on the requirements for the given runtime/exe-unit type.

        instance to the next stage in service's lifecycle - in this case, to `stopping`.

        Any unhandled exception will cause the instance to be terminated.

        **Example**::

                while True:

                    stats = (await stats_results).stdout.strip()
                    print(f"stats: {stats}")

        **Default implementation**

        Because the nature of the operations required during the "running" state depends directly
        on the specifics of a given :class:`Service` and because it's entirely plausible for a service
        not to require any direct interaction with the exe-unit (runtime) from the requestor's end
        after the service has been started, the default is to just wait indefinitely without
        producing any batches.
