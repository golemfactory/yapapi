"""Objects representing events in a Golem computation.

Everytime something important happens, an event is emitted.
Emitted events are passed to all current event consumers, set
either in :func:`yapapi.Golem.__init__` or via :func:`yapapi.Golem.add_event_consumer`.

Events are considered a semi-experimental feature:

* The backward compatibility of subsequent future updates **is not** guaranteed,
  the interface might change between major releases without prior deprecation.
* Some parts are not documented and should not be considered a public interface.

Every event is described by a set of attributes that can be divided into three groups:

* Attributes common to all events, documented on :class:`yapapi.events.Event`.
* Internal parts of `yapapi` that define the context of the event (details in the next section).
* Additional event-specific information, e.g. the reason of the agreement termination for
  the :class:`AgreementTerminated` event, described along the particular event classes.

Events should be consumed in a strict `read_only` mode: event objects are shared between all event consumers,
and their attributes are used internally by the Golem engine, so any modification may have unexpected
side effects.


Attributes shared by various events
-----------------------------------
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Value
     - Description
   * - job
     - :class:`yapapi.engine.Job`
     - The highest-level unit of a Golem computation, corresponding to a single call to
       :func:`yapapi.Golem.execute_tasks` or :func:`yapapi.Golem.run_service`
   * - subscription
     - :class:`yapapi.rest.market.Subscription`
     - Object responsible for gathering offers from the market
   * - proposal
     - :class:`yapapi.rest.market.OfferProposal`
     - A single offer from the market
   * - agreement
     - :class:`yapapi.rest.market.Agreement`
     - An agreement between provider and requestor (not necessarly confirmed)
   * - activity
     - :class:`yapapi.rest.activity.Activity`
     - Object corresponding to a provider-side activity within an agreement
   * - script
     - :class:`yapapi.script.Script`
     - [Class documentation available]
   * - command
     - :class:`yapapi.script.command.Command`
     - A single command to be executed within a Script
   * - task
     - :class:`yapapi.executor.task.Task`
     - [Class documentation available]
   * - service
     - :class:`yapapi.services.Service`
     - [Class documentation available]
   * - debit_note
     - :class:`yapapi.rest.payment.DebitNote`
     - A single debit note sent by the provider
   * - invoice
     - :class:`yapapi.rest.payment.Invoice`
     - A final invoice sent by the provider


Events inheritance tree
-----------------------

*   Only leaf events are ever emitted, other events (named :class:`*Event`) are abstract classes
*   Every abstract class has one more `yapapi` object attached then the parent, e.g.

    *   :class:`JobEvent` is an :class:`Event` that happened in the context of a particular :attr:`job`
    *   :class:`AgreementEvent` is a :class:`JobEvent` that happened in the context of a particular :attr:`agreement`

Custom events
-------------

Apart from consuming events emitted by the Python API's internal components, application authors
may wish to define their own, custom event classes. That way, Golem's event system can be easily
extended with additional, custom triggers while keeping the consumer logic uniform for both Golem's
own events and the custom ones.

Additionally, such custom events may be used to create pieces of useful, reusable components while
keeping the the emitting and consuming logic separate at the same time. As an example, one could
provide a custom MarketStrategy that consumes an event such as e.g.: `ActivityEvaluated` and have
many different applications utilize this strategy but evaluate activities in different ways.

Example usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Declare the class::

    from yapapi.events import ActivityEvent
    import attr

    @attr.s(auto_attribs=True, repr=False)
    class ActivityEvaluated(ActivityEvent):
        activity_score: float

Emit the event e.g. in the :func:`worker` function of the Task API::

    async def worker(ctx: WorkContext, tasks):
        ... #  whatever
        activity_score = await score_activity(ctx)  # Some app-specific logic
        ctx.emit(ActivityEvaluated, activity_score=activity_score)

And consume the event anywhere you want (e.g. in a MarketStrategy method)::

    def event_consumer(event):
        if isinstance(event, ActivityEvaluated):
            if event.activity_score < 7:
                print(f"Oh no! Activity {event.activity.id} is scored below 7!")

    golem.add_event_consumer(event_consumer)
