class Golem(_Engine):
    """The main entrypoint of Golem's high-level API.

    Provides two methods that reflect the two modes of operation, or two types of jobs
    that can currently be executed on the Golem network.

    The first one - `execute_tasks` - instructs `Golem` to take a sequence of tasks
    that the user wishes to compute on Golem and distributes those among the providers.

    The second one - `run_service` - instructs `Golem` to spawn a certain number of instances
    of a service based on a single service specification (a specialized implementation
    inheriting from `yapapi.Service`).

    While the two models are not necessarily completely disjoint - in that we can create a
    service that exists to process a certain number of computations and, similarly, we can
    use the task model to run some service - the main difference lies in the lifetime of
    such a job.

    Whereas a task-based job exists for the purpose of computing the specific
    sequence of tasks and is done once the whole sequence has been processed, the
    service-based job is created for a potentially indefinite period and the services
    spawned within it are kept alive for as long as they're needed.

    Additionally, the service interface provides a way to easily define handlers for
    certain, discrete phases of a lifetime of each service instance - startup, running and
    shutdown.

    As `Golem`'s job includes tracking and executing payments for activities spawned by
    either mode of operation, it's usually good to have just one instance of `Golem` active
    at any given time.
